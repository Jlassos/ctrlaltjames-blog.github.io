From many people I have heard that having a blog that chronicles ones coding journey can be fantastic and meaningful in many ways. It can allow people to see who I am, what kind of things interest me, puzzles I've solved, what exciting things I've learned, and even connect with people interested in similar topics. So, Here I am starting this blog. Starting off the main purpose of this blog is to try and follow my coding journey and along the way probably other things that interest me as well. For starters we will try and post at least once a week. Let's do this.\r\n",
